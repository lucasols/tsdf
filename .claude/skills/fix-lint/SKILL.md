# Fix Lint

## Commands

| Command       | What it runs                 | When to use                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm lint`   | `pnpm tsc && pnpm eslint`    | Full check (type errors + ESLint)    |
| `pnpm tsc`    | `tsgo -p tsconfig.prod.json` | Type checking only                   |
| `pnpm eslint` | `eslint src/ tests/ --fix`   | ESLint only (auto-fixes what it can) |
| `pnpm format` | `oxfmt src/ tests/`          | Formatting only                      |

**Always use pnpm scripts** — never rely on IDE diagnostics, they may be outdated.

## Process

1. Run `pnpm lint` to get all errors at once
2. Read and group errors by type/file
3. Fix all errors
4. Run `pnpm lint` again to verify — repeat until clean

Run ESLint/tsc only after **all** fixes are applied (they are slow).

## Critical: Fix Root Causes, Never Silence Errors

Every lint error signals a real issue. **Always fix the underlying problem** — never take shortcuts to make the error disappear.

Anti-patterns to **never** do:

- Casting with `as unknown as Type` to bypass a type mismatch — fix the mismatch at its source
- Adding a redundant null check or default value to silence a type error when the real issue is an incorrect type upstream
- Widening a function signature (e.g. accepting `undefined`) when the caller should provide a value
- Removing code that triggers an error instead of fixing why the error occurs
- Moving code around to dodge a lint rule without addressing what the rule protects against
- Replacing a specific type with a broader one (e.g. `Record<string, unknown>`) just to stop an error

When an error is hard to fix: **read the surrounding code to understand intent**, trace the types back to their source, and fix the root cause — even if it means changes across multiple files.

## Fix Rules

These are **strict project rules** — never work around them:

- **No `any`** — find the proper type
- **No `as Type` casts** — except `as const`
- **No non-null assertions (`!`)** — handle null/undefined properly (exception: allowed in test files)
- **No `@ts-expect-error` / `@ts-ignore`** — fix the actual type issue
- **No `eslint-disable` comments** — always fix the root cause
- **No `_` prefix for unused vars** — remove the unused code entirely

## Diagnostics to Ignore

- **cSpell** diagnostic errors
- **`// FIX` comment warnings** (`unicorn/expiring-todo-comments`) — intentional TODOs, only address if user asks
